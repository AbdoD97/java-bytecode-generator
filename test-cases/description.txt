In this folder we maintain the test cases we try out for each situation. 
Mainly, we have four type of statments we need to support (bonus work regarded later on)

Unit Testing:
=============
Declartaion Statments: a_code.in
Assignment Statments: b_code.in
If Statments: c_code.in
While Statements: d_code.in

Integration Testing (All cases):
================================
Use e_code.in to perform multiple cases nested in each other. Each done statement type should be appended there.

Feel free to append, or modify existing testscase files (I just wrote bunch of silly ones to start with :D).
Add new tastscase files when they appear but remmember to add a description for them here.
The testcases folder should optmistically do almost full test coverage over our program.
